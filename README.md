### Wireframes

All wireframes are the core skeleton to aid in the planning process and are not the final look of the design. I recommend that the PNGs are downloaded to be viewed in your own browser.

# Surface Plane <a name="surface-plane"></a>

## Brand Image
The branding image or better known as a logo is a key aspect to draw attention to the user. Initially I chose a popular image that is associated with the artist's 2001 album "Discovery". 
Unfortunately, this image clashed with my over all theme, therefore I went for a more subtle and stylistic approach which complimented the theme of the project. This idea was taken from the 2013 album 
"Random Access Memories" cover. The logo was downloaded as a PNG for its transparency benefits. Logos were taken from a free to use website called [pngwing](https://www.pngwing.com/).

* First Idea - [Initial logo](https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/659/114/png-transparent-daft-punk-logo-punk-rock-daft-punk-angle-text-black-and-white-thumbnail.png)
* Final Idea - [Current logo](https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/305/972/png-transparent-united-states-logo-organization-information-service-daft-punk-angle-trademark-service-thumbnail.png)




## Colour Schemes

A colour scheme is one of the first elements to communicate the message behind the design on both visual and psychological levels.
The process of choosing my palette was inspired by the artist's costume choice for the album cover of  [Random Access Memories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Access_Memories#/media/File:Random_Access_Memories.jpg) 
which combines black, white and gold. This achieves a nice, stylish and aesthetically pleasing look. All colours were generated on [html Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/).

<img src="static/images/colour-theme.png">

The final colour choices where assesed within the guidelines of [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). Each colour was used with [Contrast Ratio](https://contrast-ratio.com/#%23212121-on-%23F0F3F4) and graded within the guidelines of [W3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) .

* Light black (#212121)aginst off white back ground(#F0F3F4) (AAA Standard)
* Light grey (#6C757D) against off white background (#F0F3F4) Which fails a (AA standard) by 4px. To fit in with my design ideas for a sleek finish, I settled with a slightly darker grey of #616161 (AA Standard)
* Dark gold text (B7950B) against black background (#212121) (AA Standard)    

Below are the final colour choices for my project

* Background Colour is off white (#F0F3F4)
* Primary Font Colour lighter shade of black (#212121)
* Muted fonts (#616161)
* Primary and secondary buttons are shades of gold (#D4AC0D) with off white text (#F0F3F4)
   * Hover CSS (#B7950B) 
   * Border (#fff)
* Repeated call to action points at the head of the page 
  * Font colour off white (#F0F3F4), when active turns dark gold (#B7950B)
  * When hovered over turns to dark gold (#B7950B) to interact with the user. 
* Social links are a light shade of black (#212121) against off white backgorund (#F0F3F4)
  * Hover CSS (#D4AC0D) 

## Typography 

[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) font was used to keep a minimalistic design throughout my project to help maintain consistency. Font taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
Font weights used from 300, 400 and 500 for an easier reading experience.

## Images

The majority of the images used come from various websites from  [google images](https://www.google.com/search?q=daft+punk&sxsrf=ALeKk01K83Y46gV6bW7IWsCVMwhTjz7ZIQ:1611326366247&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwibnbW94q_uAhWROcAKHdHzBFsQ_AUoAXoECBMQAw&biw=1590&bih=837&dpr=2).
When you search 'Daft Punk', all images used will be credited in the credits section of my Readme.
The navbar image and footer image was designed by my girlfriend which was created on an app called [Procreate](https://procreate.art/).

## Visual Interactions

### navbar

The navbar links hover effects are applied to users only viewing with a desktop. To engage with the user a verticle white line sweeps under text when hoverd over. This small effect keeps the user engaged and assists with the minimalistic design. 


### Social Links

Large eye catching social links found at each footer of the page, painted light black with an off white background, repeating the design aesthetics for consistency. When the user hovers or engages with the link, a subtle background colour change to gold occurs as evidence of interaction.

### Buttons and C2A

Buttons positioned in eye-catching areas to encourage engagement are white text with a gold background when inactive, but when engaged jump to a slight off gold so the user knows their action has been acknowledged. The most important call to action is at the top of the page, to sign up to newsletter, engaging contact with user. This is white on a black background and when interacted turns gold, to match text written before.


# Features <a name="features"></a>

## Existing Features

#### Desktop, tablet and mobile responsive
   * All pages have been incorporated with Bootstrap's built in `flexbox` tool allowing each web page to be responsive on all devices, giving the user complete flexibilty on all screen sizes and resolutions. All features implemented have been 
   adjusted to size where necessary in the `stylesheet.css` using `@media`. This allows you to not only vary viewport dimensions based on screen size, but also allows me to set different style properties for different devices.

#### Navigation bar
   * The navigation bar at the head of every page has a custom designed background to match the website's theme. The navigations bar allows users to navigate each page freely. 
   `sticky-top` menus allow me to ensure the navigation access is always visible to the user when browsing larger pages of content. All navbars have the artist's logo attached with a clickable response, sending the user back to the home page.

#### Footer
   * Like with the navigation bar there is also a sticky footer at the bottom of all webpages, mirroring the design of the navigation bar.
   The footer features three interactive social links. When clicked, a new tab to the artist's soical accounts will open, meaning that the website remains intact and the user is only temporarily diverted.

#### Modals
   * A modal is a dialog box or popup window that is displayed on top of each page. They help to free up content without cluttering the surface. 
   My modal is linked with a C2A, allowing the user to sign up to a newsletter. This ensures that this initial and vital first point of contact is extremely user friendly. 


#### Media Players
   * Audio<br>
   My website is designed for users to freely browse and listen to releases of the artist's dicography. Audio snippets have been added to each release with added control, enabling users to play, pause, stop and alter the volume of media. 

   * Video<br>
    Video embedding into the browser with multiple tags allow for more control over the video and media player. The user can play, stop, pause, alter the volume, make the screen full width of device and download the media.
    Multimedia of this variety is useful to site visitors who have literacy challenges and those with visual, audio or cognitive disabilities.

 
## Features To Implement
#### Processing the contact form
* The information that the user submits will not process. With additonal Python or SQL language the data can then be processed and stored.

#### CAPTCHA
* Adding a [CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) to the form to authenticate that a real person is submitting data. This will help to block spammers and bots from collecting email addresses and submitting fake data.

#### Forum/Discussion Area
* Implementing a discussion area is a great way to get users to return to your page. This will help to create a communitiy where users will develop a much higher level of investment compared to a user just passing through. This feature could be implemented into its own navigation tab so the returning user can navigate easliy to the desired forum.

# Acknowledgements <a name="acknowledgements"></a>

- The Idea for this project came from my own personal passion of collecting electronic music from the 90's to present, and reviewing them on my own social media account. I belive that DaftPunk are a massive contributor to why electronic music is so popular today and this gave me the inspiration to base my project around them.

* Thank you to the slack community for guiding me in the right direction.

* Thank you to the tutors at code institute for that quick and helpful responses.

* Thank you to my mentor Rohit for giving me pointers along the way.

* Thank you to my girlfriend for supporting me throughout my first project and giving me helpful feedback.

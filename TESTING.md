# User Story Testing <a name="user-story"></a>

## "As a visiting user I want to browse the duo's music discography so that I can listen to their past and current releases".

 On initial contact with the home page you will see the company's logo, a call to action, four navigation links, large powerful imagery and a title. If a user requires to browse the artist's music they can do so in three possible ways: Navigate to the `discography` link on the navbar, click the C2A `find more` on the home page or click either of the sample releases that are also on the home page. Each process will navigate the user to freely browse and listen to music of their choice with ease. 
*  The concept is simple, efficient and an effective way to browse and listen to releases.
* All releases have a stylish yet easily readable title, tracklist, a large image, and media controls to play, pause, stop and adjust the volume. 
* To allow flexibility for the user, all content is responsive to all devices and view ports which will arrange content neatly, increasing fluidity. 

## "As a visiting user I want to learn more about where I can purchase their music"

 If a user wanted to purchse any music they had listend to, they can by navigating to the `discography` page and under the desired release, there is a C2A button `link to buy`. This will open a new tab leading straight to a trusted third party webpage for private sellers.

* The C2A buttons are designed with the same style and tones as all the webpages. There is also a minimal degree of interactivity with a slight colour change when hovered over.
* Each C2A section will break down neatly when viewed in alternate devices or viewports, allowing flexibility for usage.

## "As a visiting user I want to understand more about the music artist's history"

For a user to obtain more information on the artits they can click on the `about` link on the nav bar or click the C2A `Click For Bio` that is located under the artists section on the home page. 
* Once user is on the `about` page, they will find text information about artist's history. This is wrapped neatly around an image of the artists. This represents the design chocies and overall feel of the webpage to give the user a visually pleasing experience.
* On different smaller viewports, the image of the artists is hidden to allow the page to be fully respsonsive on mobile devices.
* The user also has a choice to watch a brief documentary of the artists that is sitting just below the text under a title called "Evolution". This also features media controls to play, stop, pause, adjust the volume, make media full width of the screen, and an option to download.
* Media player is fully repsonsive and will render down to be viewable on all devices and viewports.
* The colour choices, structure and design of the about page is consistent.

## "As a visiting user I want to be directed easily to the duo's social media pages"

Three social media links are located in the footer of every page under the 'connect' heading. This will send the user to a new tab (so the user is only temporarily diverted) to either `Facebook`, `Youtube` or `Instagram`.

* Each social media icon has the logo to represent each social page and is desgined with the same aesthetics and colour scheme of the webpage, all housed in a slim circular border.
* Social media links reduce in size when viewed on smaller viewports and devices so the links are in keeping with the aesthetics of the page.
* Interactivity is showed when the user hovers over a social link, changing to the colour of gold.

## "As a visiting user I want to be able to register my email so that I can keep up to date with any news or future releases"

The call to action that the user is presented with when they arrive to the site is the main point of contact for a user to register for the newsletter. Alternatively, the user can navigate to the `contact` section, where they can also register to the newsletter or submit an enquiry.
* When the C2A button on the `Home` page is interacted with it will turn gold to match the colour scheme.
* To ensure a user friendly interface, the user will only need to interact twice to register by inputting their email address, then submitting by clicking the gold `Sing Up` button.
* Alternatively, the user can obtain a more personal response by submitting an equiry. This is located in the `contact` page on the navbar.
* Both the contact form and newsletter require the correct information to be inputted, or the user will be unable to submit their data.    

# Features Testing <a name="features-testing"></a>

## Desktop, tablet and mobile responsive

Mobile responsiveness is extremely important for maintaining consistent traffic towards a webpage, as there are nearly six billion mobile users in the world today. (stat pulled from [99 Designs](https://99designs.co.uk/blog/tips/responsive-web-design-key-tips-and-approaches/)) Intial testing that my webpage was fully responsive was used with [Google Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools). This can be accessed using a chrome browser by right clicking on your mouse and clicking `inspect`.

## Chrome-Microsoft Edge 
* All testing approved

## Firefox
* No download button on audio or video players
  * Instead, right click and 'save as' to download 
* All other testing approved

## Safari
The Responsive test on Safari was done by enabling the built in "responsive mode" tag. This is enabled via the advanced settings.
* Stacking issues with the navbar
  * Fix by adding a `display: -webkit-box;` to `.banner-image` class.
  * Fix found at [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35137085/flexbox-code-working-on-all-browsers-except-safari-why)
* No volume controls on audio media player
* No Download button
  * Required to right click and 'Download'
* All other testing approved 

 ## Internet Explorer 11
Testing Internet Explorer was a problematic process. My computer is not compatible with this browser and due to the current pandemic, I could not make use of any library facilities or locate a computer which was compatible.
 To overcome this problem, I used a cross browser tesing platform called [Browserling](https://www.browserling.com/). Here I was able to test a three minute session free of charge. 
 Due to the time restrictions, I was unable to test all of the features. Below are a list of errors that I found: 

* Audio media loading with an error
* Text not wrapping around image on about page
   * `shape-outside` class has compatability issues [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/?search=shape-outside)

Testing validity may have been limited due to potential compatiblity issue with Browserling. 
Circumstantial factors limited my ability to thoroughly test Internet Explorer for this project. 
In future I would plan to locate a computer which is compatible with Internet Explorer so I can test it properly.


 # Validation Testing <a name="validation-testing"></a>

### Validation tetsing was done with two third party applications  [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for `html` and [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for testing `CSS`.

### html validation Errors

<img src="static/images/w3-validator.png">

* Fixed by removing the `target="_blank"` from the `<i>` tag 

<img src="static/images/w3-validator2.png">

* Fixed by changing `aria-labelledbye` class too `aria-label` tip from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39831658/how-to-fix-the-aria-labelledby-attribute-must-point-to-an-element-in-the-same-d)

* No other errors present 

### css validation errors 

css validation errors 

<img src="static/images/jigsaw-validator.png">

* After reseraching the issue the css validator sometimes does not recognise prefixed properties. During my testing phase, I did not encounter any errors because of this. 

<img src="static/images/css-validator.png">

* For the purpose of my css to pass through the validator I removed the property `image-wrap` resulting in no errors found.

<img src="static/images/jigsaw-validator2.png">

* Error above is due to a built-in bootstrap css class. Researched here at [Stack Overflow ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51495866/bootstrap-4-0-0-fail-w3c-validation).

## Google Light House Testing

This feature is an open source, automated tool for measuring the quality of a webpage. Any issues shown have been addressed below. 


## Home page

<img src="static/images/lighthouse-home.png">

## Discography Page 

<img src="static/images/lighthouse-discography.png">

* Low 'Best Practices" due to external links ('might not be safe') for the user to be able to purchase a certain discography. As a frequent user of the third party site that the buttons are linked to, I can confirm it is safe.  
*Images saved in 'JPG' or 'PNG' increase download time. It is recommended that image files are formatted in 'JPEG 2000' and 'JPEG XR' due to advanced compression rate. On personal testing of the page, I did not encounter any problems due to this. The performance was not affected. 

## About Page

<img src="static/images/lighthouse-about.png">

## Contact Page 

<img src="static/images/lighthouse-signup.png">

* Accessibility issues 
  * Contrast ratio of the text and the background colours would fail [W3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). I felt it would affect the over all aesthetics and colour theme if I made this change, so I did not change it.
  * No discernible names attached to the soical links.
    * As this project is intended to be minimalistic, adding text contact may hinder that.
  * Logo image is at incorrect aspect ratio
    * The Image ratio has been reduced to '200 x 100' to fit the nav bar, on visual testing this fits the visual aesthetics intended.

# Bugs <a name="bugs"></a>

* Navbar background image
  When making a subfolder for the `stylesheet.css` in the `static` folder I came across an issue resulting in the navbar background image not been displayed. Finding no solution, I had to revert back to the `stylesheet.css` being placed to it's original source. 

* Sticky Navbar
  * I encountered an issue with the `sticky-top` bootstrap class on the nav bar. When scrolling down the webpage the nav bar would dissapear half way down. Issues that cause this can be a height added to the parent element [Github](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/21919) subsequently by removing the height property from the body element and adding it to the html element. This fixed the issue.
